			<h2>The Master Coder was borned in October 9,2000 in South Korea.</h2> 
			<h2>Unlike others, he went to different schools every two years. </h2> 
			<h2>He went to Hancock Park School in Los Angelos during 1st grade and 2nd grade, stayed back in korea at 3rd grade through 5th grade, went to Britain from 5th grade to 7th grade, and went back to U.S at 7th grade. </h2> 
			<h2>He showed interest in coding before high school because his parents both majored in computer science. He also thought that computer science is the future technology that would be popular, so to earn MONEY had need to learn it anyway. </h2>
